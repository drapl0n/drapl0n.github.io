|  It was a short day, I got home from school around 18:00. After finishing some pending wor  |
|  k and having dinner, I checked my inbox for a new task, but it was empty. When I'm not as  |
|  signed a project, I usually dive into research. That day at 22:30, I decided to gather th  |
|  reat intelligence on the dark web. Sitting at my desk near the window with a view of a pa  |
|  rk, I felt the fresh breeze on a dark and quiet night. The silence was such that even the  |
|  bats hanging upside down on the tree made audible movements.                               |
|                                                                                             |
|  I booted my sandbox system, a ThinkPad T420 running OpenBSD 7.1 with updated ports and pa  |
|  ckages. PF rules were written, router's firewall was configured, VPN was activated, & the  |
|  browser was set up. I started going through forums, searching for queries, and finding so  |
|  mething worth reporting. Around an hour later, I found a strange forum that seemed promis  |
|  ing. However, the  forum's homepage didn't let me proceed due to browser settings  set at  |
|  the safest which by default disable JavaScript. It was essential for me to visit the page  |
|  , so enabling JavaScript was the only option. The forum was still blocking me from access  |
|  ing the thread; I gave up, reverted settings, and changed the tor circuit.                 |
|											      |
|  Around 1:00, I went out to buy snacks leaving system idle, disabling the tor service, dis  |
|  connecting the internet, and locking the screen. I saw characters (asterisk symbols) inse  |
|  rted into the password field, but  ignored them. Later, while performing some task on the  |
|  terminal, I went AFK scrolling notifications on my phone. Suddenly, random characters sta  |
|  rted printing on the terminal. Prompted text was difficult to interpret; only thing I saw  |
|  were random ASCII characters that were not grammatically correct or had a pattern. Shutin  |
|  g down the system was  the optimal choice at the moment. The very  next day, I booted the  |
|  system and kept it idle for a minute or two, and it started behaving the same. Everything  |
|  seemed fine, even after analyzing the system for suspicious processes/threads, network tr  |
|  affic, services, etc. I reinstalled  the OS, but character injection  still persisted. It  |
|  was confirmed that my BIOS was compromised. Imaging the existing BIOS was not possible wi  |
|  thout a  CH341a programmer and SOIC-16 clip at the time; otherwise it would have been fun  |
|  to reverse engineer that BIOS. System went back normal after flashing multiple BIOS relea  |
|  ses. QubesOS was my foremost choice as an operating system, but the thought of installing  |
|  it on an old system was difficult. After a memrory and SSD upgrade, my ThinkPad became ca  |
|  pable of handling resource-heavy qubes along with browser and other services seamlessly.   |
